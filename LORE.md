## The Shattered Accord

In 2847, humanity spans dozens of star systems connected by a network of jump gates — ancient infrastructure built during the Golden Expansion two centuries prior. For sixty years, the **Terran Accord** held the colonies together under a single governing body. That ended in 2831 with the Gate Crisis.

A cascade failure knocked out seven jump gates simultaneously, severing supply lines to the outer colonies for nearly three years. When the gates were restored, the political landscape had fractured beyond repair. Three power blocs had crystallised, each convinced the others had caused — or at minimum, exploited — the Crisis for territorial gain.

No formal war was ever declared. Instead, the factions wage a slow-burning conflict through proxies, trade embargoes, border skirmishes, and deniable operations. Independent mercenary companies — operators of **Combat Frames**, the dominant weapons platform of the era — are the currency of this cold war. Every faction hires them. Every faction denies it.

Your company is one of these outfits.

## Combat Frames

Combat Frames are bipedal armoured war machines standing 8-12 metres tall, powered by compact fusion reactors. They replaced conventional armour two generations ago when advances in reactor miniaturisation made it possible to mount weapons that would previously require a tank battalion.

Frames are classified by tonnage:
- **Light** (20-35t) — fast reconnaissance and flanking platforms
- **Medium** (40-55t) — the backbone of any lance, versatile and affordable
- **Heavy** (60-75t) — fire support and breakthrough units
- **Assault** (80-100t) — walking fortresses, slow but devastating

A frame's chassis determines its reactor output, armour capacity, hardpoint layout, and movement profile. Everything else — weapons, equipment, and pilot — is modular. This is what makes mercenary work viable: a skilled operator can maintain and refit frames in the field, swapping loadouts between contracts to match the mission.

The pilot sits in the **Head** compartment — a reinforced cockpit housing sensors, targeting systems, and life support. It is the smallest and most protected section of the frame, but also the most critical. A cockpit breach is often fatal. Experienced pilots know that survival in a headshot comes down to reflexes and luck in equal measure.

## The Factions

### Crucible Industries

**"Progress demands investment."**

**Colour:** Cyan | **Headquarters:** Foundry Station, Avalon System | **Preference:** Energy weapons, heavy armour

Crucible Industries began as a mining consortium in the resource-rich Avalon System. During the Gate Crisis, while other colonies starved, Crucible's deep-space refineries kept producing. They stockpiled rare metals, fusion fuel, and reactor components — and when the gates reopened, they held the leverage to become something far more than a mining company.

Today, Crucible is a corporate state. Its board of directors governs four star systems with ruthless efficiency. Citizens are employees. Laws are contracts. Disputes are settled by arbitration panels staffed by Crucible lawyers. The corporation's philosophy is simple: capital solves all problems. If a colony needs defence, Crucible builds a better weapon. If a rival encroaches, Crucible buys their supply chain and strangles them quietly.

Their frames reflect this doctrine. Crucible chassis are overengineered — heavy armour plating, high-output reactors, and a preference for energy weapons that never run dry. They favour attrition warfare: outlast the enemy, grind them down, and let superior materiel decide the outcome. Their exclusive designs are expensive, but a Crucible frame will still be fighting long after cheaper machines have gone silent.

Crucible hires mercenaries for operations they need deniability on — corporate espionage gone kinetic, hostile acquisitions of frontier mining rights, and "security contracts" that are border wars in all but name. They pay well and on time. They also expect results.

**Notable traits:**
- Corporate hierarchy — every interaction is transactional
- Highest-quality hardware, highest prices
- Energy weapon doctrine minimises supply chain dependency
- Views the other factions as inefficient relics

### Terran Directorate

**"Order through strength."**

**Colour:** Gold | **Headquarters:** High Command, Sol System | **Preference:** Balanced doctrine, precision weapons

The Terran Directorate claims to be the legitimate successor of the Terran Accord — the original governing body of human space. When the Accord collapsed, the military brass in the Sol System refused to accept it. They declared martial law, consolidated control over the core systems, and rebranded as the Directorate. In their telling, they are not a new faction. They are the legal government, and everyone else is in rebellion.

The Directorate controls the most populated systems and the oldest infrastructure. Their military is the largest and best-trained conventional force in human space. They maintain a professional officer corps, standardised equipment, and a doctrine built on combined arms and disciplined execution. Where Crucible throws money at problems and the Outer Reach improvises, the Directorate follows procedure.

This rigidity is both their strength and their weakness. Directorate forces are predictable but devastating when they execute correctly. Their frames are balanced designs — adequate armour, adequate firepower, adequate mobility. Nothing flashy. Everything functional. Their exclusive weapons tend toward precision: gauss technology that hits hard at range with minimal energy draw.

The Directorate hires mercenaries reluctantly. Military leadership views independent operators as undisciplined and unreliable — but they also recognise that some operations require forces that can't be traced back to High Command. Directorate contracts tend to come with more rules, more oversight, and more strings attached than the other factions. They also come with the backing of the most powerful conventional military in known space, which has its own value.

**Notable traits:**
- Military hierarchy — rank and protocol matter
- Balanced, no-nonsense hardware
- Largest standing army but stretched thin across many systems
- Views itself as the only legitimate government

### Outer Reach Collective

**"Free people. Free stars."**

**Colour:** Orange | **Headquarters:** The Drift (mobile station), Fringe Systems | **Preference:** Ballistic/missile weapons, fast frames

The Outer Reach Collective is less a government and more an idea held together by mutual necessity. When the Gate Crisis hit, the frontier colonies were the hardest struck. Cut off from the core systems, they had no stockpiles, no manufacturing base, and no military to speak of. They survived by pooling resources, raiding abandoned stations, and building what they needed from salvage.

That experience forged a culture of fierce independence and practical ingenuity. The Collective is a loose alliance of frontier worlds, free stations, mining outposts, and nomadic fleet groups. There is no central authority — decisions are made by consensus among elected delegates who meet aboard the Drift, a converted colony ship that serves as the Collective's mobile capital. In practice, local leaders run their territories as they see fit, and the Collective only unifies when an external threat demands it.

Their frames reflect frontier pragmatism. Outer Reach designs are lighter, faster, and cheaper than their counterparts — built to hit hard and get out before the enemy can respond. They favour ballistic and missile weapons because ammunition is easier to manufacture from raw materials than the precision focusing arrays that energy weapons require. An Outer Reach pilot will tell you that a machine gun made from scrapyard steel kills just as dead as a Crucible laser that costs ten times as much.

The Collective's relationship with piracy is complicated. Some frontier groups are legitimate colonists defending their homes. Others are raiders who prey on shipping lanes. The line between "freedom fighter" and "pirate" depends on who's telling the story. The Collective officially condemns piracy. Unofficially, some of their best combat pilots learned their trade on the wrong side of that line.

Mercenaries are the Collective's first choice for heavy operations — they lack the standing forces to project power, so they hire it. Contracts from the Outer Reach pay less than the other factions, but they come with fewer questions, more freedom, and the goodwill of people who remember what it means to fight for survival.

**Notable traits:**
- Decentralised — no single leader, local autonomy
- Cheapest hardware, fastest frames, highest ammunition dependency
- Blurred line between militia, mercenary, and pirate
- Views the Directorate as tyrants and Crucible as parasites

## The Mercenary Life

You are the commander of an independent mercenary company. You own your frames, employ your pilots, and choose your contracts. The factions are your employers — and sometimes your enemies.

The work is straightforward: a faction posts a contract, you accept it, you deploy your lance, and you complete the objective. Payment on results. The politics behind the contract are not your concern — unless you want them to be.

**Standing** with each faction determines your access and opportunities. Work for Crucible often enough and their markets open to you — better prices, exclusive hardware, higher-paying contracts. But every job you take for one faction strains your relationship with their rivals. A company trusted by Crucible will find Directorate and Collective doors closing. Choose carefully, or spread your contracts thin and stay neutral. There is no right answer. There is only the answer you can afford.

Your company lives and dies by its balance sheet. Frames need maintenance. Pilots need pay. Ammunition needs restocking. Every day without a contract is a day your reserves shrink. Take too many risks and you'll lose irreplaceable pilots and expensive hardware. Play it too safe and you'll go bankrupt watching bolder companies take the contracts you passed on.

The galaxy doesn't care about your problems. It has plenty of its own.

## The Galaxy

Human space spans roughly forty star systems connected by jump gates. The core systems — Sol, Avalon, and their neighbours — are densely populated and well-developed. The fringe systems are sparsely settled, resource-rich, and dangerous.

**Faction territories** form rough clusters:
- The **Directorate** holds the core: Sol and its immediate neighbours. The most populated, most developed, and most heavily patrolled space in the galaxy.
- **Crucible Industries** controls the mid-rim: Avalon and surrounding resource systems. Wealthy, industrialised, and corporate-controlled.
- The **Outer Reach Collective** occupies the fringe: scattered frontier systems with thin populations and rich mineral deposits. Lawless in places, fiercely independent everywhere.

Between these territories lie **contested systems** — border regions claimed by multiple factions or controlled by none. These are where the real fighting happens. Pirate groups, insurgent cells, and rogue militias operate in the gaps between faction control. For a mercenary company, contested space is where the most dangerous contracts live — and the most lucrative.

**Travel** between systems requires jump gates and costs fuel, credits, and time. Moving deeper into faction territory means better contracts and access to exclusive markets, but also longer supply lines and deeper entanglements. The frontier offers freedom and risk in equal measure.
